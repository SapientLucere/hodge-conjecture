Summary of the Hodge Conjecture
The Hodge Conjecture is a major unsolved problem in algebraic and complex geometry. It asserts that certain de Rham cohomology classes on non-singular complex projective varieties are algebraic, meaning they are sums of the Poincaré duals of homology classes of subvarieties. Proposed by William Hodge in the mid-20th century, this conjecture remains one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, with a reward of $1 million for a proven solution. The conjecture has been proven in some special cases but remains unresolved in general.
